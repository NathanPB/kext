# Benchmarks

I'm putting a huge effort in making this library perform well and keep it easy and readable. According to benchmarks, some functions can already perform better than the stdlib.

The automated benchmarks can be found [here](https://github.com/NathanPB/kext/actions/workflows/benchmark.yml).
Navigate through the logs and attached report files...

If you want to test it by yourself, use the ``bench`` script: ``$ yarn bench``.

Remamber, [this code very fast](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/pull/437)
