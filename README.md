## The f

I think that the ECMAScript stdlib is not enough for me, so I'm attempting to rewrite all of the usefull Kotlin's stdlib into Typescript.

Along the way, I discovered many possibilities to improve it and make the life of the JS/TS developer much easier.
So I plan to, with this lib, expose a bunch of useful and type-safe functions to make the development experience much easier and more pleasant.

Yes, it's that simple
